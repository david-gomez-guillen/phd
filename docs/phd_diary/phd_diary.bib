	abstract = {Gaussian processes offer a flexible kernel method for regression. While Gaussian processes have many useful theoretical properties and have proven practically useful, they suffer from poor scaling in the number of observations. In particular, the cubic time complexity of updating standard Gaussian process models can be a limiting factor in applications. We propose an algorithm for sequentially partitioning the input space and fitting a localized Gaussian process to each disjoint region. The algorithm is shown to have superior time and space complexity to existing methods, and its sequential nature allows the model to be updated efficiently. The algorithm constructs a model for which the time complexity of updating is tightly bounded above by a pre-specified parameter. To the best of our knowledge, the model is the first local Gaussian process regression model to achieve linear memory complexity. Theoretical continuity properties of the model are proven. We demonstrate the efficacy of the resulting model on several multi-dimensional regression tasks.},

In this paper, we propose a new algorithm, {COBALT}, for constrained grey-box optimization problems that combines multivariate {GP} models with a novel constrained expected utility function whose structure can be exploited by state-of-the-art nonlinear programming solvers. {COBALT} is compared to traditional {BO} on seven test problems including the calibration of a genome-scale bioreactor model to experimental data.

A popular approach to tackle such problems is Bayesian optimisation ({BO}), which builds a response surface model based on the data collected so far, and uses the mean and uncertainty predicted by the model to decide what information to collect next. In this paper, we propose a novel variant of the well-known Knowledge Gradient acquisition function that allows it to handle constraints.

	abstract = {We present an information-theoretic framework for solving global black-box optimization problems that also have black-box constraints. Of particular interest to us is to efficiently solve problems with decoupled constraints, in which subsets of the objective and constraint functions may be evaluated independently. For example, when the objective is evaluated on a {CPU} and the constraints are evaluated independently on a {GPU}. These problems require an acquisition function that can be separated into the contributions of the individual function evaluations. We develop one such acquisition function and call it Predictive Entropy Search with Constraints ({PESC}). {PESC} is an approximation to the expected information gain criterion and it compares favorably to alternative approaches based on improvement in several synthetic and real-world problems. In addition to this, we consider problems with a mix of functions that are fast and slow to evaluate. These problems require balancing the amount of time spent in the meta-computation of {PESC} and in the actual evaluation of the target objective. We take a bounded rationality approach and develop partial update for {PESC} which trades off accuracy against speed. We then propose a method for adaptively switching between the partial and full updates for {PESC}. This allows us to interpolate between versions of {PESC} that are efficient in terms of function evaluations and those that are efficient in terms of wall-clock time. Overall, we demonstrate that {PESC} is an effective algorithm that provides a promising direction towards a unified solution for constrained Bayesian optimization.},

abstract = {In this paper, we consider the problem of black-box optimization using Gaussian Process ({GP}) bandit optimization with a small number of batches. Assuming the unknown function has a low norm in the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space ({RKHS}), we introduce a batch algorithm inspired by batched finite-arm bandit algorithms, and show that it achieves the cumulative regret upper bound \$O{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}ast({\textbackslash}sqrt\{T{\textbackslash}gamma\_T\})\$ using \$O({\textbackslash}log{\textbackslash}log T)\$ batches within time horizon \$T\$, where the \$O{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}ast({\textbackslash}cdot)\$ notation hides dimension-independent logarithmic factors and \${\textbackslash}gamma\_T\$ is the maximum information gain associated with the kernel. This bound is near-optimal for several kernels of interest and improves on the typical \$O{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}ast({\textbackslash}sqrt\{T\}{\textbackslash}gamma\_T)\$ bound, and our approach is arguably the simplest among algorithms attaining this improvement. In addition, in the case of a constant number of batches (not depending on \$T\$), we propose a modified version of our algorithm, and characterize how the regret is impacted by the number of batches, focusing on the squared exponential and Mat{\textbackslash}'ern kernels. The algorithmic upper bounds are shown to be nearly minimax optimal via analogous algorithm-independent lower bounds.},

	abstract = {There are deep and important philosophical diÔ¨Äerences between Bayesian and frequentist approaches to quantifying uncertainty. However, some practitioners choose between these approaches primarily on the basis of convenience. For instance, the ability to incorporate parameter constraints is sometimes cited as a reason to use Bayesian methods. This reÔ¨Çects two misunderstandings: First, frequentist methods can indeed incorporate constraints on parameter values. Second, it ignores the crucial question of what the result of the analysis will mean. Bayesian and frequentist measures of uncertainty have similar sounding names but quite diÔ¨Äerent meanings. For instance, Bayesian uncertainties typically involve expectations with respect to the posterior distribution of the parameter, holding the data Ô¨Åxed; frequentist uncertainties typically involve expectations with respect to the distribution of the data, holding the parameter Ô¨Åxed. Bayesian methods, including methods incorporating parameter constraints, require supplementing the constraints with a prior probability distribution for parameter values. This can cause frequentist and Bayesian estimates and their nominal uncertainties to diÔ¨Äer substantially, even when the prior is ‚Äúuninformative.‚Äù This paper gives simple examples where ‚Äúuninformative‚Äù priors are, in fact, extremely informative, and sketches how to measure how much information the prior adds to the constraint. Bayesian methods can have good frequentist behavior, and a frequentist can use Bayesian methods and quantify the uncertainty by frequentist means‚Äîbut absent a meaningful prior, Bayesian uncertainty measures lack meaning.

This causes {BO} to waste function evaluations on bad design choices (e.g., machine learning hyperparameters) that the expert already knows to work poorly. To address this issue, we introduce Bayesian Optimization with a Prior for the Optimum ({BOPrO}). {BOPrO} allows users to inject their knowledge into the optimization process in the form of priors about which parts of the input space will yield the best performance, rather than {BO}'s standard priors over functions, which are much less intuitive for users. {BOPrO} then combines these priors with {BO}'s standard probabilistic model to form a pseudo-posterior used to select which points to evaluate next. We show that {BOPrO} is around 6.67x faster than state-of-the-art methods on a common suite of benchmarks, and achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on a real-world hardware design application. We also show that {BOPrO} converges faster even if the priors for the optimum are not entirely accurate and that it robustly recovers from misleading priors.},

The classical grid search or trial-error methods are exponentially expensive in large parameter spaces, and Bayesian optimization ({BO}) offers an elegant alternative for global optimization of black box functions. In situations where the black box function can be evaluated at multiple points simultaneously, batch Bayesian optimization is used. Current batch {BO} approaches are restrictive in that they fix the number of evaluations per batch, and this can be wasteful when the number of specified evaluations is larger than the number of real maxima in the underlying acquisition function. We present the Budgeted Batch Bayesian Optimization (B3O) for hyper-parameter tuning and experimental design - we identify the appropriate batch size for each iteration in an elegant way. To set the batch size flexible, we use the infinite Gaussian mixture model ({IGMM}) for automatically identifying the number of peaks in the underlying acquisition functions. We solve the intractability of estimating the {IGMM} directly from the acquisition function by formulating the batch generalized slice sampling to efficiently draw samples from the acquisition function. We perform extensive experiments for both synthetic functions and two real world applications - machine learning hyper-parameter tuning and experimental design for alloy hardening. We show empirically that the proposed B3O outperforms the existing fixed batch {BO} approaches in finding the optimum whilst requiring a fewer number of evaluations, thus saving cost and time.},

Batch methods, however, require the modeling of the interaction between the different evaluations in the batch, which can be expensive in complex scenarios. We investigate this issue and propose a highly eÔ¨Äective heuristic based on an estimate of the function‚Äôs Lipschitz constant that captures the most important aspect of this interaction‚Äîlocal repulsion‚Äîat negligible computational overhead. A penalized acquisition function is used to collect batches of points minimizing the non-parallelizable computational effort. The resulting algorithm compares very well, in run-time, with much more elaborate alternatives.},

	abstract = {Despite its importance, choosing the structural form of the kernel in nonparametric regression remains a black art. We define a space of kernel structures which are built compositionally by adding and multiplying a small number of base kernels. We present a method for searching over this space of structures which mirrors the scientific discovery process. The learned structures can often decompose functions into interpretable components and enable long-range extrapolation on time-series datasets. Our structure search method outperforms many widely used kernels and kernel combination methods on a variety of prediction tasks.},
