Cost-effectiveness modeling is an important tool in medicine to assess not only how effective new health strategies are compared to current practices but also if they are economically sustainable. Among other things, these models require a set of parameters to adequately represent the natural history of the disease, such as probabilities of getting the disease or dying from it. Even though base values for these parameters can be extracted from the scientific literature, they often require small adjustments to match an expected outcome in the model. In many cases, this calibration process can be computationally expensive and traditional optimization methods often used can take a long time to find a good solution due to their simple heuristic approaches. In this work we explore Bayesian optimization to improve the calibration performance by guiding the process with domain-specific knowledge and exploiting inherent structural properties in the solution space. These improvements include efficient constraint handling, prior specification for parameters, additive model decomposition or GPU-friendly computation, among others.
